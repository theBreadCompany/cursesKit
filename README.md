# cursesKit

This repo is a prototype only.

## TODO

- include dependency for ncurses
- write a `TerminalWindow` class or similiar which enables
	- observation of
  		- terminal (window) size
  		- cursor position (if applicable)
	- (key) input
	- (key) navigation

## use cases

This package will be useful for two repos of mine already:

- swiftbar, my progressbar, which will be able to automatically resize itself
- SwiftTUI, which will be a wrapper around this to enable SwiftUI like syntax
